\label{sec:SDL2-Game-Structure-section}

% Give me the basic structure of the game using SDL2
In this section, we will explore the fundamental structure of our SDL2-based poker game. The game follows a standard SDL2 application architecture with the following key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initialization}: Setting up SDL2, creating windows and renderers
    \item \textbf{Game Loop}: The main loop that handles:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Event handling (user input)
            \item Game state updates
            \item Rendering
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Resource Management}: Loading and managing textures, fonts, and sounds
    \item \textbf{Cleanup}: Proper deallocation of resources
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Components}
The game is structured around several core classes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{Game}: Main class managing the game state and loop
    \item \texttt{TextureManager}: Handles loading and rendering of images
    \item \texttt{InputHandler}: Processes user input
    \item \texttt{Player}: Manages player data and actions
    \item \texttt{Card}: Represents individual playing cards
    \item \texttt{Deck}: Handles the deck of cards and dealing
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:game-structure} illustrates the relationship between these components.
