\section{Acknowledgement}
\label{sec:acknowledgment-section}

\hspace{1cm} We would like to sincerely thank our theory teacher, Nguyen Hai Minh, and our lab teachers, Nguyen Thi Thao Nhi and Phan Thi Phuong Uyen, for providing the project and valuable resources for self-studying. Although their guidance was indirect, the materials helped us understand the fundamental concepts needed for this project.

\hspace{1cm} We first consisted of a team of three; however, one of our teammates did not feel this was the correct field for him and left our team. Despite the obstacle that challenged us, we tried our best to give our best effort to finish the project.

\hspace{1cm} We consider ourselves very lucky that this opportunity for the project was given to us and allowed us to learn by experience. Any limitations or shortcomings in this work are entirely our responsibility. We hope that this project will be a stepping stone for us to improve our skills and knowledge in the future.
