\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\hspace{1cm} The implementation of the project is divided into two main parts: core mechanics and graphical user interface. The core mechanics of the game are implemented using classes and structures. The graphical user interface is implemented using the SDL2 library. The project is developed using C++ programming language.

\subsection{Core Mechanics}
\label{subsec:core-mechanics}

\hspace{1cm} The core mechanics of the game are implemented using classes and structures. The core classes of the project are \texttt{Game}, \texttt{Player}, \texttt{Card}, and \texttt{Deck}. The \texttt{Game} class manages the game state and loop. The \texttt{Player} class manages player data and actions. The \texttt{Card} class represents individual playing cards. The \texttt{Deck} class handles the deck of cards and dealing.
